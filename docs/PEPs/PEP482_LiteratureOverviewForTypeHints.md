# PEP 482 - Literature Overview for Type Hints

## Abstract

This PEP is one of three related to type hinting. This PEP gives a literature overview of related work. The main spec is [PEP 484](PEP484_TypeHints.md).

## Existing Approaches for Python

### mypy

(This section is a stub, since [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) is essentially what we are proposing.)

### Reticulated Python

[Reticulated Python](https://github.com/mvitousek/reticulated) by Michael Vitousek is an example of a slightly different approach to gradual typing for Python. It is described in [this paper by Vitousek, Siek and Baker](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/UnderstandingPandasAndNumpySourceCode/blob/main/docs/articles/DesignAndEvaluationofGradualTypingforPythonVitousek2014.pdf).
